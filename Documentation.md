# Documentation for DLL-Overwritter

# Functions
**Console_** if you are using a KRNL or any exploit DLL that has a Console, set this to TRUE.

**UsingKrnl_** this is obvious, if you are using KRNL, and not any other(s), set this to TRUE.

**ClearLines()** clears everything in console. use only on a DLL with console, but with no key.

**Overwrite()** main function, overwrites any text and modifies it with the user text.

# Text

**ConsoleTitle_** rename this to your console title (example: krnl v1.06v) would be renamed.

**Text1_** add some lines or texts to your 'modified' DLL to make it more realistic.

**Text2_** add the credits to the owner (this case would be IceBear) or the DLL developer.

**Text3_** tell the user you need a key system and make them cry.

**Text4_** some friendly message but im not friendly so add whatever you want here.

# How to use?

Be redirected to Dual Injector on github.com/SpeedSterKawaii/Dual-Injector and download it.

Add the first DLL name (my-krnl.dll) which is the modified DLL, and the real DLL (krnl.dll).

**Please make sure (my-krnl.dll) the source i've made is injected into ROBLOX first!**

Open ROBLOX and press 'Dual Inject', wait until the console opens and krnl is injected.

# How to add to my exploit?

Soon to be documentated.
