# DLL-Overwritter

This **overwrites** any DLL text such as console. **Too dumb to understand?**

As you know, Krnl, WeAreDevs and many other types of API's (or DLL's) have a console.

**Krnl** has a Key Console, and do you even like it? Well you can change the text!

**Documentation is included for newbies and skids so your welcome.**
